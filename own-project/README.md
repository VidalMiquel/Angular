# Portfolio Project

Thanks to the knowledge gained, I am defining my own portfolio to collect the projects I have completed using a Bootstrap template from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/freelancer).

## Objective

The final objective is to share this portfolio with potential hiring companies to showcase a summary of my projects and work experience.

## Live Demo

You can view my portfolio at: [https://mvidalc.netlify.app](https://mvidalc.netlify.app)

## Features

- **Project Showcase**: A collection of projects I've worked on, demonstrating my skills and experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly layout.
- **Contact Information**: Easy access for potential employers to reach out.
